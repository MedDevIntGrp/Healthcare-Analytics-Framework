# Healthcare-Analytics-Production-Framework
Healthcare Informatics Framework (HCIF) is an interdisciplinary engagement model (methodologies and roadmap). The Framework has five tightly coupled pillars, Health Science, Social Science, Information Science, Technology Science and Management Science, (with multiple sub-pillars each), that can help health and technology scientists and practitioners to communicate effectively for developing integrated healthcare analytical solutions, by utilizing: a communication bridge among stakeholders to deliver effective healthcare solution; a roadmap of Requirements translation from Healthcare to Informatics; a top-down solution blueprint for bottom-up implementation; the science of collecting health problem-related Massive data and transforming it to information and knowledge to access in real-time; and an ARTS Self-Service Healthcare Analytics Solutions Enabler for improving care delivery, population health management strategies and the revenue cycle.
# Background
Health Industry is “Data-Rich - but Information-Poor”, per academic scholar Peter Bernus and Ovidiu Noran from Griffith University, and has estimated over 100s of petabytes of patient case-data in the USA alone and growing, which has not been used properly to understand the historical perspectives of diseases, diagnoses and treatments. Moreover, most of our healthcare organizations don’t have a correct understanding of human-care insights, due to HealthIT challenge, and that is why healthcare is becoming more expansive financially with human-loses.  To find solutions to help HealthIT challenges, I have researched on some of the challenges while converting Health Data to information and knowledge. But, much further research is needed. Doing so, I have been working on a framework, HCIF, that can help to utilize Silo health systems, Data-Rich, to produce ARTS (Accurate, Reliable, Timely and Secure) self-service solutions, Information-Rich.
